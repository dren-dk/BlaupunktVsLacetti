The blaupunkt-2011.lirc lirc config file is generated using the new-style RC.

The lirc2c script converts the lirc config file to a c datastructure, which
can be interpreted into a remote control signal using the remote.c and
remote.h statemachine.

See remote-test.c for a simple example of how to pull the mark/space sequence
out of the statemachine, run make test to see it written out.

The main firmware is in bpremote.c

The generator is somewhat limited in that it will only support the
SPACE_ENC|CONST_LENGTH type of signal and it will output the baseband
signal, so adding modulation will be up to the user of the state machine,
in my application I only use the baseband signal, so it doesn't matter
to me.


The Lacetti steeing wheel is wired up using switches to connect the
two wires via different resistors:
Mute: 1k8
Src:  1k3
Next: 820 Ohm
Vol+: 330 Ohm
Vol-: 0 Ohm

To measure which button is pressed I simply connect one wire to ground and
the other via a 1k5 resistor to +5V, then use an ADC input to measure
the voltage.  


The schematic is very simple, take one ATMega88 or any other AVR you have on
hand, then connect the equivalent of these pins:

* 7, 20, 21:   +5V
* 8, 22:       GND
* 23 (ADC0):   Pull up using 1k5 and steering wheel remote.
* 24 (PC1):    RC out to the headunit (C2 pin 11)
* 1

* 3 (UART TX): Debugging serial out

* 18: MISO  ISP6 pin 1
* +5V       ISP6 pin 2
* 19: SCK   ISP6 pin 3
* 17: MOSI  ISP6 pin 4
* 1:  Reset ISP6 pin 5
* GND       ISP6 pin 6

The power supply is a traditional 78L05 with a diode and couple of uF
on the input to cope with the noisy car power and a couple of 100 nF
decoupling caps on the regulated side.

You could easily make do with a much smaller AVR than the ATmega88 I
used, but that was what I had in my bag.


Notice that it is very important to cut two wires in the A-block of
the iso connector before installing a new headunit in a Lacetti or
you will burn out fuses:
1: Sub-out GND (is tied to headlight +12V in the car)
5: Auto-antenna +12V (is tied to GND in the car)

If wire 1 isn't cut your headlight fuse will burn out.
If wire 5 isn't cut your remote control will not be powered.
