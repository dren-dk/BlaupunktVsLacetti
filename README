The blaupunkt-2011.lirc lirc config file is generated using the new-style RC.

The current plan is to write a code generator that will take the LIRC file
and generate a C file containing the state-machine needed to transmit the
code contained in the lirc file.

The generator will be somewhat limited in that it will only support the
SPACE_ENC|CONST_LENGTH type and it will output the baseband signal, so adding
modulation will be up to the user of the state machine, in my application I'll
only use the baseband signal, so it doesn't matter to me.
